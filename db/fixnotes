increased allowed filesize for jdp to 40000

Should definitely change this to just be neo4j instead of jdp, and execute the server start as neo4j somehow

Things to understand better
       what is happening while blocking on recv (is it the database doing work? likely)
       read about indexing -- DEFINITELY CHECK THIS OUT
       figure out if it is the saving that is slowing things down

looks like removing save speeds things up a little bit, try using batch creation, and just overall make
the code hit the database less if at all possible

according to the py2neo docs, a single attribute update caused communication with the server!
No wonder it sucked!!!
no longer the case in py2neo 2.0

from py2neo import watch could make things really fun

graph.push() for batching
