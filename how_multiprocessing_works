it looks like in my multiprocessing tracebacks that Popen is being imported from forking.py

start basically calls Popen

join calls Popen.wait

bootstrap doesn't appear to be called within process.py itself

bootstrap does:
	  sets up basic attributes like _current process = self
	  closes stdin and makes it dev/null instead
	  calls self.run!!!
	  catches SystemExit calls -- read about this exception
	  handles all exits from process
	  

forking.py

looks like the main thing that needs to be read is Popen itself (which is portable for unix and windows)

I'll document the unix version



dont forget to read _exit_function from util.py!
