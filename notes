need splitport function

if a web address doesnt start with http://, add it

at first, we will naively ignore subdomains

## How to safely kill all processes

## Make no assumptions about where the KeyboardInterrupt will be caught
## this is wrong, master should be the one to recieve signal i think but make sure

## if caught in master, send message to all children telling them to quit, and then
## block for each process until it dies

## if caught in child, send message to master through pipe notifying that a keyboard interrupt has been
## recieved, and clean up what was being done

## master must poll for messages at start of while True, and so must child


## RAGING CLUES:

## in emacs shell, the C-c interrupt isn't being caught consistantly
## in terminal window, C-c is caught first time
## after exit, bash never comes back, but is still running
## C-c becomes nonresponsive in both emacs and bash now

# this answer doesn't seem right? ive definitely experienced the parent quitting but children
