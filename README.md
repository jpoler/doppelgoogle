# doppelgoogle

Installation instructions:

first install git, python 2.7, pip, and virtualenv. On a Unix system with a decent package manager this should be cake. Sorry Windows users!

Now in the directory where you want to store this project:

```bash
mkdir <PROJECT_NAME> && cd <PROJECT_NAME>
git clone git@github.com:jpoler/doppelgoogle.git
cd doppelgoogle
virtualenv env
j start
```
Make sure that your env has been activated, you should see an (env) before your command-line prompt
